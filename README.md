How to use Blind Creator Tag API
Blind Creator Tag API tag for server GTM allows sending user data (event_name, user_agent, hostname, pathname, unique_click_id, bc_tracker_utm, bc_link_code, creator_id, utm_campaign, utm_source, utm_term, utm_content, utm_medium).

Blind Creator Tag API does not support event deduplication, meaning that combining browser and server tracking is currently impossible because the event will be counted twice.
